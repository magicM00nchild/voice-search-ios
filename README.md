## Overview

This Voice Transcribe App is a simple iOS application that utilizes native speech transcription to convert spoken words into text. This app is designed for users who need a quick and efficient way to transcribe their voice into written format. I created this first version for my bachelor thesis about voice search.

- **Real-Time Transcription**: Transcribes speech in real-time as you speak.

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0 or later
- Xcode 12.0 or later
- Swift 5.0 or later

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Xcode:
